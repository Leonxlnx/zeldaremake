# fable-cursor — work log

## Current task
Bootstrapping the whole Phase 1 foundation in one branch so the second agent can join safely:

1. Vite + Three.js r186 + TypeScript scaffold with frozen module contracts
   (`src/world/system.ts`, `layout.ts`, `terrain/heightfield.ts`, `wind/wind.ts`, `capture/api.ts`).
2. Collaboration protocol (`AGENTS.md`, `.agents/`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `INBOX.md`).
3. The Gauntlet: 50-item rubric (`gauntlet/rubric.json`, hash-locked), loop (`GAUNTLET.md`),
   anti-cheat + capture/compare/score/take tooling, CI workflows.
4. The Director's Monitor live site (`site/`) — hourly before/after takes on GitHub Pages.
5. First real content passes on every world system via parallel sub-agents (terrain+hardscape,
   trees, vegetation, structures, atmosphere+lighting), then integration + reference-comparison
   loop iterations.

Rubric targets this session: W01–W42 first passes; hard focus on W02 (stairs), W03 (flagstones),
W08/W09 (trees), W15 (grass), W25/W26 (house + lanterns), W30–W32 (light + haze), W37 (shot match).

## Files / systems being touched
Everything under `src/`, `gauntlet/`, `site/`, `reference/`, `.github/`, root docs — this is the
bootstrap. Once this branch is up, ownership follows the map in `AGENTS.md`. Sub-agents each own
one `src/world/<system>/` directory and do not touch the others.

## Completed work
- Scaffold renders all 6 saved viewpoints headlessly (SwiftShader) in ~20 s; capture API + audit
  rollup working (`gauntlet/scripts/capture.mjs`).
- Reference clip analysed frame by frame; layout authored to the four hero shots
  (`src/world/layout.ts`, `reference/manifest.json`, `reference/frames/`).
- 50-item rubric written and locked; `rubric-lock.mjs --check` passes.
- (commits listed in PR once pushed)

## Important decisions
- **Units/axes:** metres, +Y up, +X east, −Z north. Plaza = origin. Camera eye ≈ 1.75–1.9 m.
- **Sun:** azimuth −128°, elevation 34° (light from WNW-high, i.e. behind-left of shot A) — measured
  from shadow direction on the plaza in frames 1/14/24. Match before "improving".
- **Fog:** cool blue-grey `#c5d1cf`, near 28 / far 190, plus a separate ground-mist layer. Fog is
  NOT allowed to hide unfinished terrain (rubric W32 + depth-histogram check).
- **Determinism:** `createRng` everywhere; capture mode fixes sim time at 12.5 s before each shot.
- **Stairs:** 18 steps, rise 0.30, tread 0.42, width 2.7 (counted on frame 1 / crop). Direction
  (1, −0.35) from base (7.5, 0, −1.5).
- **Textures:** CC0 only, `public/textures/<set>/{color,normal,roughness,ao,height}.jpg`, 1K–2K,
  credited in `public/textures/CREDITS.md`.
- **Takes** live on the orphan `monitor` branch (append-only), never in feature branches, so two
  agents cannot conflict on take data.

## Hourly gauntlet log
### 10:30 UTC — tick 1 (pre-tooling)
Integrated WIP capture (quality=low, B/D, commit 5bf083e) — sub-agent passes are landing but
not yet committed. Biggest gaps vs reference right now:
1. **Trees**: giants are still untextured pale cylinders/blobs in B/D backgrounds; canopy roof
   absent → sky too bright/open behind the house (ref B has dense dark canopy, dappled light).
2. **Lantern bough in B**: the lantern-tree limb crosses the top of frame B as a thick plain
   green cylinder ~4 m over the camera — needs bark, taper and foliage, or the B camera nudged
   so it frames like the reference (branches high, not a beam across the top).
3. **Colour/atmosphere**: whole frame reads cool-grey and washed; reference is warm gold-green
   light on a cool blue haze with much deeper shadows. Mist volume currently flattens the mid
   ground; terrain material still grey vertex colour in places.
Also: codex's terrain review findings (cache order-dependence, sampler ≠ mesh) go to the terrain
sub-agent before its pass lands; props integrated (`src/world/props`, codex).

### 11:10 UTC — tick 2 (tooling still landing; capture only)
Integrated WIP capture with codex props iteration 2 (quality=low, B/D; monitor
`data/reviews/props-d3c1086/`). Purple flowers, embankment grass, mist, shafts, thatch house
with vines and pod lanterns, sign, doorway prop cluster all present. Biggest gaps vs reference:
1. **Canopy/trees**: backgrounds are pale untextured trunks + bright grey wash — no dark canopy
   roof, so B/D lack the reference's enclosed, dappled feel (W09/W10/W11 open).
2. **Grade/contrast**: image is low-contrast beige-grey; reference is olive/khaki with deep cool
   shadows and warm highlights. Apply the ANALYSIS palette + height-fog density at integration
   (W34).
3. **Hardscape tone**: stairs and flagstones are uniform light grey slabs; reference stone is
   warmer, darker in the joints, with moss and wear gradients (W02/W03/W20).
Also: lantern bough still a thick plain beam across the top of B (trees pass pending).

## Pending corrections from reference/ANALYSIS.md (apply at integration, one commit)
- `config.ts` palette → olive/khaki low-key (reference hero frames: hue 47–51°, sat 0.16–0.19,
  lum 0.35–0.39, 0 % blue sky): grass 0x8a8c55/0x5c6233/0x3a4420, moss 0x8b8948/0x5a523b,
  flagstone 0xa79774/0x746d5d, bark 0x7a7468/0x473e33, white bark 0xb9b3a4, canopy 0x4c5537,
  fern 0x69692e, flowers 0x7a4f8c; sky/hemi warm greys 0xcfd3c8/0xe2dfd0/0xc9c8b4/0x4a4a30.
- Fog: reference is ~60 % hazed at 30 m → exponential/height haze density ≈ 0.03, colour
  0x95968b → 0xa3a399 far, warm ground mist 0x7a796d; keep `far ≥ 150` for the audit.
- Sun elevation 34 → 38 (azimuth stays −128; shafts are screen-anchored upper-left in every
  heading in the footage, so god rays should be a screen-space effect anchored upper-left).
- Layout: stairs rise 0.30 → 0.24 (heightfield ramps the last 1.1 m); lantern branch lower
  (from ≈ (−5.5, 4.0, −6.3) to (3.5, 2.6, −3.0), 2 orange pods on 1 m cords) with the
  lantern-tree at ≈ (−7.5, 2.0, −7.5); signpost → (5.5, 1.0, −9.8); house trunkRadius 3.5;
  log arch radius 4.0 + 3 lanterns; boulders stair-foot → (5.9, 0.1, −3.0), shot-d → (−0.8, 0,
  −2.5); viewpoint retargets A/B/C/D/F per ANALYSIS §14 (F becomes eye-level along the stair
  axis, fov 42, not a look-up).
- Rubric traps: W18 purple ≥ 0.3 % is stricter than the reference itself (0.02 %) — meet it
  with saturated blooms in D's foreground; W30's azimuth range is consistent with shots A/B
  only (the footage's light is camera-relative) — note in the visual verdict.

## Known issues
- Terrain sampler contract defects reported by codex (`.agents/reviews/codex-terrain-review.md`):
  5 cm memo cache makes `height()` order-dependent; sampler vs rendered mesh up to 18 cm on the
  stair ramp; LOD seams. Fix pending in the terrain pass (lattice-consistent sampler).
- Far hills are one low-res mesh; distant layering is the atmosphere agent's job.
- The first capture of a fresh page sometimes returns a black frame before shaders finish
  compiling — `capture.mjs` needs the variance-retry guard (tooling task, in flight).
- Box is CPU-saturated by parallel SwiftShader captures (load ≈ 20 on 4 cores); full six-view
  high-quality takes wait until the sub-agent passes finish.

## Recommended next work (for the second agent)
Pick anything NOT claimed in `gauntlet/claims.json`. Good self-contained candidates:
- `src/world/rocks/` — hero boulders with ridged displacement, cracks, moss, scree (W23, W24).
- `src/world/postfx/` — SMAA/TAA-quality AA, SSAO/GTAO, restrained bloom for lanterns (W35, W36).
- `src/world/trees/distant.ts` — 400+ LOD'd far trees for horizon layering (W13).
- Reviews: file visual verdicts on my takes (`npm run gauntlet -- --review …`) — I cannot review
  my own (GAUNTLET.md D7).
